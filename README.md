# Pixels_Collapse
The superficiality of selfie <br /><br />
This project aims to critique today's selfie culture. I made the person's visibility less clear than a regular camera view, divided it into squares to create an abstract feeling, and after the person looks at himself and takes photo - the photo collapses and the superficiality of the selfie collapses with it.

To run this project open cmd, <br />
run npm i http-server <br />
run http-server <br />
open the project in the browser - localhost:****

To see the project optimally, it should be opened from the mobile phone.
