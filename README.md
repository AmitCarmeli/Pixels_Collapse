# Pixels_Collapse
This project aims to critique today's selfie culture. I made the person's visibility less clear than a regular camera view, divided it into squares to create an abstract feeling, and after the person looks at himself and takes photo - the photo collapses and the superficiality of the selfie collapses with it.

To run this project open cmd,
